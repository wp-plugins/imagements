this plugin lets users put images in a comment.

== Description ==

This plugin lets users put images in comments. The user can upload the image through the comment form to your server and choose a easy name for it.
Then it puts the [afbeelding=<name>] tag in the comment and the image will appear!
This first version only gives the basic features, many more are to come in the upcoming updates!

this will be fixed as soon as possible in future updates</b>
